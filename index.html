    <p><strong>Last Updated: October 26, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>JoshTechApps ("we," "us," or "our") develops King James Bible with Apocrypha (KJVA Bible) ("the App"), a free, ad-supported application providing daily Bible verses, guidances, prayers, quizzes, highlights, note-taking, and customization features.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Processing Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data</strong>: We use advertising networks (Google AdMob, Unity Ads, Vungle/Liftoff) to display ads (e.g., Interstitial, Native Advanced, Rewarded). These networks may collect anonymized device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address (for country-level targeting), device type, and ad interaction data (e.g., views/clicks). No app content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images) or SMS is accessed. See their privacy policies:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob's Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Ads Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>: Firebase Analytics collects anonymized app usage data (e.g., screen views, button clicks like quiz starts, session duration) and device basics (e.g., OS, model). No personal details or app content (e.g., quiz answers, notes) are collected, as outlined in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reporting Data</strong>: Firebase Crashlytics collects anonymized crash reports (e.g., stack traces, device model, OS version) to improve stability. No user content or personal data is included, per <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: Notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, highlights, and customizations (e.g., fonts, colors) are stored locally on your device using Room persistence. This data is fully offline, not transmitted to our servers, and deleted upon app uninstall.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: If enabled in the App’s settings, we use device permissions to schedule daily verse/prayer reminders at 08:00 and 20:00. No content is tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Initiated Actions</strong>: Shares of verses (e.g., images to X, gallery, or SMS) are handled by your device’s sharing system and not collected or tracked by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect names, emails, exact locations, photos, files, or SMS unless you voluntarily provide them (e.g., via email contact).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Ad networks (Google AdMob, Unity Ads, Vungle) use anonymized data to serve relevant ads and measure performance (e.g., click rates).</li>

        <li><strong>Crash Reporting</strong>: Firebase Crashlytics data identifies and fixes crashes for improved stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: Notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, and customizations provide personalized features within the App, stored offline.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Device permissions deliver user-configured daily reminders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share local data, user content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images), notification preferences, or device files (e.g., photos, SMS) with third parties. Our advertising and analytics partners may collect and process anonymized data independently:</p>

        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics</strong>: Shares anonymized usage and crash data with Google (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy</a>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the following options regarding your data:</p>

        <li>Disable notifications in the App’s settings or your device’s notification settings.</li>
        <li>Delete local data (e.g., notes, favorites) by clearing the App’s data or uninstalling via device settings.</li>
        <li>Manage user-initiated shares (e.g., verse images, SMS) through your device’s sharing permissions.</li>
        <li>Review and manage ad preferences via our partners’ policies:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Controls</a></li>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Local data (notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, highlights, customizations) is retained on your device until you clear the App’s data or uninstall it. We do not store personal data on our servers. Third-party data is retained per their policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Data Retention</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Data Retention</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Data Retention</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is rated E for Everyone and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not submit any personal information through the App. Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor children’s internet usage to enforce this policy. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it immediately. Contact us with concerns.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on Android’s built-in security features, such as app sandboxing, to protect local data on your device. No data is transmitted to our servers, eliminating server-side breach risks. Third-party partners implement their own security measures per their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>8. International Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union (GDPR) or California (CCPA), you may have rights like data access or deletion. Since we store data locally and use third-party services for ads/analytics, exercise these rights via device settings or our partners’ privacy controls. Contact us for data subject request assistance.</p>
